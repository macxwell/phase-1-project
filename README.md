## Description

This project is a simple web application that demonstrates the use of HTML and JavaScript to interact with a JSON Server backend. It includes a form that users can fill out, which is then processed and stored on the server.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system to run the JSON Server.
- Any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/macxwell/the-project-2.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```
   cd yourprojectname
   ```
3. Install JSON Server.
   ```
   npm install -g json-server
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the JSON Server.
   ```
   json-server --watch db.json
   ```
   This command will start the JSON Server and watch for changes in the `db.json` file, which acts as a mock database for your application.

2. Open the HTML file in your web browser.
   - You can simply double-click the HTML file to open it in your default web browser.
   - Alternatively, you can use a live server extension if you're using an IDE like Visual Studio Code.

### Using the Application

1. Fill out the form on the webpage with the required information.
2. Submit the form.
   - Ensure your JSON Server is running to process and store the form data.
3. Check the console or the `db.json` file to see the stored data.

## Features

- Simple form submission
- Interaction with a backend server using JSON Server
- Basic form validation (optional feature you might have implemented)
